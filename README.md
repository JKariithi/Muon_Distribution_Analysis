# Muon Distribution Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze muon distribution patterns from cosmic ray simulations generated using CORSIKA.
Specifically, the notebooks demonstrate how to read the output file, process the data, and interpret muon counts and spatial distributions at different heights and locations.
